# Stats Tracker
This FoundryVTT module aims to provide a clean way of keeping track of any data
points you want within Foundry, whether that be dice rolls, or other things like
how many natural 1s to natural 20s you get.

I was inspired by the dicestats module, however it only allows tracking dice
statistics, which is something I found myself needing to work around and struggle
against, so I decided to make this module to fill that gap while improving upon
the graph rendering.

compendium within your world!
